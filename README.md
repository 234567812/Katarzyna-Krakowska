5. NameAge.java

Program prompts a user to enter their name and age. Using a while loop, users name is printed to the screen number of times equal to his/her age.

6. ForLoop.java

Program prompts a user to enter ten numbers, using a counter controlled loop. Once numbers are entered, program adds all odd numbers and prints total to the screen.

7. Months.java

Program includes an array which stores the month names. Using the String method contains, program prints to the screen names of months containning letter "r".
